Warn when the thematic breaks (horizontal rules) violate a given or
detected style.

Options: `string`, either a corect thematic breaks such as `***`, or
`'consistent'`, default: `'consistent'`.

`'consistent'` detects the first used thematic break style and warns when
subsequent rules use different styles.

## Fix

[`remark-stringify`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/HEAD/packages/remark-stringify)
has three settings that define how rules are created:

*   [`rule`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/HEAD/packages/remark-stringify#optionsrule)
    (default: `*`) â€” Marker to use
*   [`ruleRepetition`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/HEAD/packages/remark-stringify#optionsrulerepetition)
    (default: `3`) â€” Number of markers to use
*   [`ruleSpaces`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/HEAD/packages/remark-stringify#optionsrulespaces)
    (default: `true`) â€” Whether to pad markers with spaces

See [Using remark to fix your Markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint#using-remark-to-fix-your-markdown)
on how to automatically fix warnings for this rule.

## Presets

This rule is included in the following presets:

| [`remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/main/packages/remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide) | `'---'` |

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm]:
Node 12+ is needed to use it and it must be `imported`ed instead of `required`d.

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-lint-rule-style
```

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `remarkLintRuleStyle`.

## Use

You probably want to use it on the CLI through a config file:

```diff
 â€¦
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     â€¦
     "lint",
+    "lint-rule-style",
     â€¦
   ]
 }
 â€¦
```

Or use it on the CLI directly

```sh
remark -u lint -u lint-rule-style readme.md
```

Or use this on the API:

```diff
 import {remark} from 'remark'
 import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'
 import remarkLint from 'remark-lint'
 import remarkLintRuleStyle from 'remark-lint-rule-style'

 remark()
   .use(remarkLint)
+  .use(remarkLintRuleStyle)
   .process('_Emphasis_ and **importance**')
   .then((file) => {
     console.error(reporter(file))
   })
```
