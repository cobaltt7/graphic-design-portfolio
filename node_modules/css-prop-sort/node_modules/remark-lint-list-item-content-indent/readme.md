## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm]:
Node 12+ is needed to use it and it must be `imported`ed instead of `required`d.

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-lint-list-item-content-indent
```

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `remarkLintListItemContentIndent`.

## Use

You probably want to use it on the CLI through a config file:

```diff
 …
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     …
     "lint",
+    "lint-list-item-content-indent",
     …
   ]
 }
 …
```

Or use it on the CLI directly

```sh
remark -u lint -u lint-list-item-content-indent readme.md
```

Or use this on the API:

```diff
 import {remark} from 'remark'
 import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'
 import remarkLint from 'remark-lint'
 import remarkLintListItemContentIndent from 'remark-lint-list-item-content-indent'

 remark()
   .use(remarkLint)
+  .use(remarkLintListItemContentIndent)
   .process('_Emphasis_ and **importance**')
   .then((file) => {
     console.error(reporter(file))
   })
```
