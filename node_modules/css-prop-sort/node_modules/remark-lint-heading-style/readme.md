Warn when a heading does not conform to a given style.

Options: `'consistent'`, `'atx'`, `'atx-closed'`, or `'setext'`,
default: `'consistent'`.

`'consistent'` detects the first used heading style and warns when
subsequent headings use different styles.

## Fix

[`remark-stringify`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/HEAD/packages/remark-stringify)
formats headings as ATX by default.
This can be configured with the
[`setext`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/HEAD/packages/remark-stringify#optionssetext)
and
[`closeAtx`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/HEAD/packages/remark-stringify#optionscloseatx)
options.

See [Using remark to fix your Markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint#using-remark-to-fix-your-markdown)
on how to automatically fix warnings for this rule.

## Presets

| [`remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/main/packages/remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide) | `'atx'` |

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm]:
Node 12+ is needed to use it and it must be `imported`ed instead of `required`d.

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-lint-heading-style
```

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `remarkLintHeadingStyle`.

## Use

You probably want to use it on the CLI through a config file:

```diff
 â€¦
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     â€¦
     "lint",
+    "lint-heading-style",
     â€¦
   ]
 }
 â€¦
```

Or use it on the CLI directly

```sh
remark -u lint -u lint-heading-style readme.md
```

Or use this on the API:

```diff
 import {remark} from 'remark'
 import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'
 import remarkLint from 'remark-lint'
 import remarkLintHeadingStyle from 'remark-lint-heading-style'

 remark()
   .use(remarkLint)
+  .use(remarkLintHeadingStyle)
   .process('_Emphasis_ and **importance**')
   .then((file) => {
     console.error(reporter(file))
   })
```
