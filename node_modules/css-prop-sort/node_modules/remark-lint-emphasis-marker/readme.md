Warn for violating emphasis markers.

Options: `'consistent'`, `'*'`, or `'_'`, default: `'consistent'`.

`'consistent'` detects the first used emphasis style and warns when
subsequent emphasis use different styles.

## Fix

[`remark-stringify`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/HEAD/packages/remark-stringify)
formats emphasis using `_` (underscore) by default.
Pass
[`emphasis: '*'`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/HEAD/packages/remark-stringify#optionsemphasis)
to use `*` (asterisk) instead.

See [Using remark to fix your Markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint#using-remark-to-fix-your-markdown)
on how to automatically fix warnings for this rule.

## Presets

This rule is included in the following presets:

| Preset | Setting |
| - | - |
| [`remark-preset-lint-consistent`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/main/packages/remark-preset-lint-consistent) | `'consistent'` |
| [`remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/main/packages/remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide) | `'*'` |

## Example

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm]:
Node 12+ is needed to use it and it must be `imported`ed instead of `required`d.

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-lint-emphasis-marker
```

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `remarkLintEmphasisMarker`.

## Use

You probably want to use it on the CLI through a config file:

```diff
 â€¦
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     â€¦
     "lint",
+    "lint-emphasis-marker",
     â€¦
   ]
 }
 â€¦
```

Or use it on the CLI directly

```sh
remark -u lint -u lint-emphasis-marker readme.md
```

Or use this on the API:

```diff
 import {remark} from 'remark'
 import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'
 import remarkLint from 'remark-lint'
 import remarkLintEmphasisMarker from 'remark-lint-emphasis-marker'

 remark()
   .use(remarkLint)
+  .use(remarkLintEmphasisMarker)
   .process('_Emphasis_ and **importance**')
   .then((file) => {
     console.error(reporter(file))
   })
```
